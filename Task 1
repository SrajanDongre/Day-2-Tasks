Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Ans:- 
Differentiator	                                         HTTP/1.1	                                                   HTTP/2

Year                                	                  	1997                                                      	2015

Key Features	                      	It supports connection reuse i.e.                              Uses multiplexing, where over
                                      for every TCP connection there could be multiple               a single TCP connection resources to be delivered
                                      requests and responses, and pipelining where the               are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at
                                      client can request several resources from the server           the same time. It is done using streams which can  
                                      at once. However, pipelining was hard to implement             be prioritized, can have dependencies and individual
                                      due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was            flow control. It also provides a feature called
                                      not a feasible solution.                                       server push that allows the server to send data
                                                                                                     that the client will need but has not yet requested.
                                                                                    
Status Code	                        	Introduces a warning header field to carry additional          Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers,status
                                      information about the status of a message. Can define          codes remains the same.	 
                                      24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more          
                                      efficient.                                                    
                      
Authentication Mechanism              It is relatively secure since it uses digest                  Security concerns from previous versions will continue
                                      authentication, NTLM authentication.                          to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to 
                                                                                                    deal with them due to new TLS features like connection 
                                                                                                    error of type Inadequate_Security.

Caching	                            	Expands on the caching support by using additional            HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching.
                                      headers like cache-control, conditional headers like          If-Match and by using entity tags.	 With the server push
                                                                                                    feature if the client finds the resources are already 
                                                                                                    present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.

Web Traffic	                          HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and          	HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively
                                      reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. However,         reduce the page load time by a greater margin along
                                      TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding (resources         with being less sensitive to network delays.
                                      can be downloaded simultaneously by using multiple 
                                      domains), connection reuse and pipelining, there is an 
                                      increased risk of network congestion.
